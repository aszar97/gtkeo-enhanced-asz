<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>&#127774;</p>
<p class="p2"> 
Hello. My name is Adela. I'm 23 years old and a junior at Lewis. 
I am the third child in a family of 9 comprised of my parents, 5 sisters and little brother. 
I have a 3 year old nephew named Omar and a 6 year old niece named Hanan who I love dearly. 
I am the owner of a special cat named Mona, who is turning 4 this summer. I'm so grateful to have her. 
My major is Supply Chain Management with a concentration in Logistics. The supply chain in any industry 
is essentially the systems, resources, people, facilities, and technologies that come together
to produce and deliver a good to the consumer. When it comes to a cup of coffee, the supply chain starts with
the farmers and growers of the bean and runs through the intermediaries, goverment officials, exporters 
and suppliers until the bean is delivered to the retailer, who makes the coffee available for consumption.
I'm optimistic about my career path post graduation and I'm really enjoying what I'm studying.

<h2> My Favorite Hobby </h2>
<p class="p3">
My favorite hobby is going on walks. Over last summer and into the fall I'd take an hour 
or two at least 3-4 days a week and walk through forest preserves near my house. I found it to be
really great for my mental and physical health. It allowed me to disengage from the world 
and I'd often listen to podcasts or music. With the winter weather I haven't been outside much
at all, but I hope to in the coming months once it gets a bit warmer. I also like to read, mostly 
books on topics like religion, philosophy, human behavior and psychology.
